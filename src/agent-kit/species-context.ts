/**
 * The species half of the agent's context (Spec 3 §3.4).
 *
 * TWO THINGS, AND BOTH ARE LOAD-BEARING.
 *
 * 1. NORMALIZE, DO NOT MERELY PARSE. The bilingual `.transform()` that turns a legacy English-only
 *    string/array into `{ en, es }` runs ONLY inside `speciesRecordSchema.parse`. A bare `JSON.parse` — what
 *    this builder used to do — hands the agent a legacy-shaped record while the contract promises the
 *    normalized object. That is a live contract break for every species not yet re-cured.
 *
 * 2. THE BRIEF REPLACES THE BLOGPOST, EXCLUSIVELY. `researchBrief` is the trusted primary research;
 *    `blogBodyEn` is the editorial REINTERPRETATION and is TRANSITIONAL — present only while a species has
 *    no brief yet. They are never both non-null: sending both would double the species payload and reopen
 *    the exact ambiguity this change closes (which one is authoritative?).
 *
 * TRANSITIONAL: remove `blogBodyEn` entirely once the one-time re-curation has filled every brief (Spec 3
 * §6's cleanup). Until then it is the only species knowledge an un-re-cured species has.
